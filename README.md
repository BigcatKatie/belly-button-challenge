# belly-button-challenge
Background:
This challenge is to make an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes found in human navels. The dashboard allows users to visualize the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found in each test subject and explore the demographic information for each test subject.

Features in the dashboard:
Interactive Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found in the selected test subject.
Interactive Bubble Chart: Shows the distribution and frequency of bacterial species across all OTUs for the selected test subject.
Demographic Information: Displays key demographic details of the selected test subject.
Dropdown Menu: Allows users to select different test subjects and see updated charts and metadata.

Applied what we learned in this module:
# HTML: For structuring the webpage, the main HTML file containing the structure of the dashboard
# JavaScript (D3.js, Plotly.js): For it fetches data, creates the chart, and updates the charts and managing interactivity

GitHub Pages: For deploying the project online.
